## Problem Statement

Identify app categories with high revenue potential but lower install numbers on the Google Play Store. This would involve analyzing  which categories generate the most revenue relative to the number of installs they receive. This could be useful for app developers who want to target potentially lucrative but under-discovered niches within the Google Play Store. 

Since, the games has highest no. of installs but the revenue is not generated from games. The highest no. of revenues is generated from family category but it is less in compared to installs made in games. 

The company can focus on generating more paid games to earn more revenue.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & in view tab under Data preview section, check "column distribution", "column quality" & "column profile" options.

- Step 4 : In power query change app and category type to text.
- Step 5 : Replaced error value to 1 in app column.
